    "# Hidden Markov Models - Alpha and Beta\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook overviews two slightly different quantitites often used in the analysis of Hidden Markov Models, $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$. These terms are, respectively, very similar to the forward and backward probabilities, and are, specifically, their 'conditionally reversed' probabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\alpha_t(i) \\propto P(Y^{t} | x_t = i) $$\n",
    "$$ \\beta_t(i) \\propto P(Y^{[t+1 , T]} | x_t = i) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, both of these quantities are calculated in a recursive fashion (through  a process explained in more depth in a supporting document). The reason that we discuss these quantities here, is that they have a relatively deep link with common derivations of some ofthe likelihood-based optimization methods common in HMMs. Specifically, one can show that the total likelihood function $\\mathcal{L}(\\theta)$ is simply the product  $\\sum_i \\alpha_t(i)\\beta_t(i)$ (which turns out to be independent of $t$).  Similarly, the most common version of the Expectation Maximization algorithm used in HMMs is conveniently described in terms of these expressions as well (which we will discuss in a later notebook).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we wimply show how to calculate these terms, some tests to verify their correctness, and a little discussion around their interpretation."
